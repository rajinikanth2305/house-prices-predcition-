# house-prices-predcition-
predicted house prices using liner regression model


 worked with housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa, United States from 2006 to 2010. You can read more about why the data was collected [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10691898.2011.11889627). You can also read about the different columns in the data [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/307/data_description.txt).
This dataset was originally compiled by Dean De Cock for the primary purpose of having a high quality dataset for regression. You can read more about his process and motivation [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10691898.2011.11889627) and download the dataset [here](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/235/AmesHousing.txt).
 
 
 Here are some of the columns:


1.Lot Area: Lot size in square feet.
2.Overall Qual: Rates the overall material and finish of the house.
3.Overall Cond: Rates the overall condition of the house.
4.Year Built: Original construction date.
5.Low Qual Fin SF: Low quality finished square feet (all floors).
6.Full Bath: Full bathrooms above grade.
7.Fireplaces: Number of fireplaces.

In this project, i started by building intuition for model based learning, explored how the linear regression model worked, understood how the two different approaches to model fitting worked, and some techniques for cleaning, transforming, and selecting features.
